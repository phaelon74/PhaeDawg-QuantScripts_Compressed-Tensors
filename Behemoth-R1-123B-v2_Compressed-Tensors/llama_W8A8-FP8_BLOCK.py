#   * quantize the weights to fp8 with block-wise quantization (128x128 tiles) via ptq
#   * quantize the activations to fp8 with dynamic per-token-group (128) quantization
#
# Key difference from FP8_DYNAMIC:
#   - FP8_BLOCK uses block-wise quantization for weights instead of channel-wise
#   - Provides better granularity for quantization in large models
#   - No calibration dataset is required (quantization is done without data)

# Apply quantization with sequential onloading.
# =========================
# By passing model_path as a string (instead of a loaded model), oneshot() will
# load layers one at a time from disk -> GPU -> process -> store in system RAM.
# This prevents VRAM exhaustion for large models like Behemoth-R1-123B-v2.
#
# Note: W8A8-FP8_BLOCK does NOT require a calibration dataset.
# The quantization is performed via PTQ (Post-Training Quantization) without data.
